// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

void main() {
  testWidgets('MangaCat app smoke test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Build our app and trigger a frame.
    await tester.pumpWidget(const MangaCatApp());

    // Verify that the splash screen or initial screen loads
    // Since this is a manga app, we'll look for common elements
    // You can modify these expectations based on what your SplashScreen shows
    
    // Wait for any animations or async operations to complete
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    
    // Add your specific test expectations here
    // For example, if your splash screen has a title:
    // expect(find.text('Manga Cat'), findsOneWidget);
    
    // Or if it has a specific widget:
    // expect(find.byType(SplashScreen), findsOneWidget);
